# Granular Matter Compression Experiment

This codebase supports an experiment led by Dr. Peshkov on how granular matter is affected by compression.

## Current Capabilities

- Vertically move two lasers over a setup of Orbeez-like particles suspended in Triton (with added dye for visibility).
- Record and crop video from a camera attached to a motorized system.
- Convert video into an HDF5 image stack, which is then used to detect particle centers.

## Purpose

The goal is to study how compression affects particles â€” particularly changes in position and rotation.

Previous studies suggest that under repeated compression, particle **positions remain unchanged**, but their **rotations vary**.  
We aim to replicate and verify those findings!
