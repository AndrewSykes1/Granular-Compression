This codebase is for an experiment led by Dr. Peshkov pertaining to how granual matter is effected by compression. 
In the current stages there is code to:
-Move 2 lasers vertically at a setup of orbeez like particals in triton (with some added dye for visability)
-Record and properly crop a view provided by a camera attatched to a motor
-Turn this video file into a hdf5 image stack, which then is used to find the centers of particals
This is in hope of being able to determine what effects compression has on particals, namely does position and rotation alter?
According to other studies, under repetitive compression the position of each partical will not change but the rotation will.
We hope to replicate that!
